-- Project Instructions
Your task is to first identify the three best-performing industries based on the number of new unicorns created in 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined.
From those industries (1), you will need to find the number of unicorns within these industries (2), the year that they became a unicorn (3), and their average valuation, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places (4).
With the above information you can then finish your query to return a table containing industry, year, num_unicorns, and average_valuation_billions. For readability, the firm have asked you to sort your results by year and number of unicorns, both in descending order.

WITH yearly_rankings AS (SELECT AVG(valuation) as average_valuation, 
			 industry, 
			 EXTRACT(year FROM date_joined) as year, 
			 count(*) as num_unicorns
			  from funding
		      inner join dates 
			  on dates.company_id=funding.company_id
		      inner join industries 
		      on funding.company_id=industries.company_id
		      group by industry,year),
top_industries AS (SELECT industry,COUNT(industries.*)
from dates
inner join industries
on dates.company_id=industries.company_id
WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM date_joined) IN (2019,2020,2021)
GROUP BY industries.industry
ORDER BY count desc
LIMIT 3
)

SELECT industry, year, num_unicorns, ROUND(AVG(average_valuation/1000000000),2) as average_valuation_billions
FROM yearly_rankings
WHERE year IN ('2019','2020','2021')
AND industry IN 
(SELECT industry
from top_industries)
GROUP BY industry, year, num_unicorns
ORDER BY year desc, num_unicorns desc
